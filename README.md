FILES
1. CodeBook.md describes all the variables, the data, and the transformations and work that was performed to clean up the data.
2. run_analysis.R script performs the following work:
    (1) Merges teh training and teh testing data sets to create one data set;
    (2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    (3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
    (4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
    (5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject;
3. data_complete is a tidy data set created with write.table().

PEER-REVIEWED CRITERIA
1. The submitted data set is tidy;
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts;
3. Github contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with unites, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable;
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
